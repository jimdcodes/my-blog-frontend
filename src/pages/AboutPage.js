    <p>
        Welcome to my page! I'm Jimmy Dinh, a dedicated professional with a passion for leveraging technology to drive impactful results. With a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from California State University of Los Angeles, I have cultivated a diverse skill set in various technical and analytical tools, including SQL, Power BI, Python, and Mathematica. My expertise extends to Agile & Scrum methodologies, and a range of programming languages, such as JavaScript, React, HTML, and 
        CSS.

        My previous experiences in roles equipped me with strong organizational and communication skills, alongside a commitment to maintaining confidentiality and creating an environment conducive to learning and growth. I have also had the privilege of serving as an Instructional Student Tutor and a Supplemental Instructor, allowing me to contribute to academic improvements in STEM subjects through personalized instruction and innovative teaching 
        strategies.

        Driven by a proactive and adaptable approach, I constantly seek to expand my horizons. My passion for technology is reflected in my projects, including the development of a blog website and an Android/Web app that used to track live COVID-19 information. Additionally, my completion of various HTML and CSS projects underscores my commitment to continuous learning and
